🏨 Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

A scalable, production-ready machine learning system designed to predict hotel reservation cancellations. Built with a complete MLOps pipeline using Kubernetes, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Kubeflow, and Minikube on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This project demonstrates how to automate ML workflows for training, testing, and deploying models efficiently in a cloud-native environment. The predictive system can be extended for fraud detection, targeted marketing, and revenue optimization.
